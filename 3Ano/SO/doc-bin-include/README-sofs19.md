## Prerequisites

On Ubuntu, to generate documentation you need the following packages installed: 
_doxygen_.

```
sudo apt install doxygen
```

In other Linux distributions you need equivalent packages installed.

******

## Generating documentation

The code is documented in **doxygen**. So, you can easily generate **html** documentation pages.

```
cd XXXXX/doc
doxygen
firefox html/index.html &
```

Of course, you can change firefox by your favourite browser.
